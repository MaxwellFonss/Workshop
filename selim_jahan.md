## Response to What is Human Development? By Selim Khan

While Selim Khan does acknowledge the importance of traditional statistics such as economic growth and wages in the advancement of human development, he argues that our typical understanding of the definition of human development is fundamentally wrong. Khan argues that typical measurements not only cannot account for the important necessity of having choices and input in our daily lives, but also cannot account for the equally important non-wage-earning work, such as artistic work and caretaking. In addition to not being able to measure progress, Selim Khan points out that the traditional measurements of human development may draw attention away from what he sees as the three most important problems facing progress today: the exploitation of child labor, a persistent gender wage gap, and our ineffectiveness in properly responding to both manmade and natural disasters. As a solution, Selim Khan suggests that we not just “look at the door” of statistics, but instead use measurements such as the human development index to paint a more holistic picture of the problems that our society has yet to overcome.

## Response to The Best Data You've Never Seen by Hans Rosling

In order to illustrate the importance of healthcare in the development of economic growth, Hans Rosling uses descriptive statistics to illustrate the growth of South Korea’s economy vs. Brazil’s economy over the course of fifty years. While Brazil was significantly more wealthy than South Korea during the 1960s, South Korea's focus on healthcare created a better educated and safer population that was able to quickly overtake Brazil in terms of GDP growth during the years following the Korean war. Rosling provided further evidence by illustrating the child mortality rate and GDP per capita of the United Arab Emirates, which had tremendous wealth due to oil, but still lagged other countries until money was properly invested into essential services such as hospitals and education. In addition to the importance of healthcare, Rosling warned the audience of using average data to generalize not only regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, but even countries such as South Africa. By splitting up countries into their respective income brackets, Rosling demonstrated that even populations within the same borders can live vastly different lives and that contextualization is essential to effectively providing aid for human development.
